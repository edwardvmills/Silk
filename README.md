## Description
Silk is the new name of the [NURBSlib_EVM](http://edwardvmills.github.io/NURBSlib_EVM/) project.

## Installation
Recommended installation is through the FreeCAD [Addon Manager](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/AddonManager) via `Tools -> Addon Manager`

## Documentation
Until documentation and tutorials are rewritten for Silk, [NURBSlib_EVM](http://edwardvmills.github.io/NURBSlib_EVM/) is the best source of information regarding the project. 
The tutorials can still be followed, simply skip setup, color, and display mode instructions. All setup is handled by installing the workbench, and the object display properties have been set to reasonable defaults. ([Silk Wiki in progress](https://github.com/edwardvmills/Silk/wiki))
